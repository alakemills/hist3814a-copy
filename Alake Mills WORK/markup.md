# My favourite piece of academic work

My favourite piece of academic writing was an essay i wrote, writing essays is a process. If you follow the steps in the process, you will be able to finish the assignment much faster and earn a better grade.

And speaking of a process, I applied the three step writing process i have learned in high school: *(1) prewrite, (2) rough draft and (3) finished paper.* The prewrite step is thinking of a thesis and conducting research. And the written paper is the rough draft. Finally, i need to edit and revise the paper before submitting it.

> I like Grammarly to help with the editing, but the subscription costs about 
> $30 per month, $60 per quarter, or $140 per year. At the very least, i used 
> MS Word as spell/grammar checker . i also did review other students papers.
