## instructions

The 'log' is a scratch pad where you jot down observations, problems, solutions, links that help you, anything really, as you work through the relevant tutorials. **It is ok if you get stuck** when doing the tutorials; your log is what enables me to help you overcome the challenges. Your log gives me a glimpse into your workflow and practice. Hit the pencil icon to edit this document.

It can be helpful to drag-and-drop screenshots of your work when you hit an error. On a mac, hit cmd + 4 to highlight the area of the screen you want to screenshot; on a Windows machine, you can hit the windows key + g to do the same thing. Drag and drop the screenshot into this folder. You can embed the image into this text file by following this pattern:

`![](the-screenshot-filename.png)`

Once you hit the 'commit' button, Github will embed the image. **nb** nothing saves unless you hit the commit button.
