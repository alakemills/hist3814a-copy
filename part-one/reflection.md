## Prompt:

> Drawing on what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital history’ might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kinds of ‘digital silences’ did you encounter? What has excited you? Finally, where do you want to go, with digital history?

### tips

> Digital history is concerned with the incorporation of digital methods in historical research practices. Thus, digital history aims to use methods, concepts, or tools from other disciplines to the benefit of historical research, making it a form of methodological interdisciplinarity *(Klein, 2014)*. This requires expertise of different facets, such as history, technology, and data management, and as a result many digital history activities are a collaboration of scholars and professionals from different backgrounds.

Such collaborations would fit Svensson’s characterisation of digital humanities as a fractioned trading zone (Svensson, 2011, 2012). Simply stated, this means first that digital humanities functions as heterogeneous collaborations, i.e., with participants from different disciplinary backgrounds, and second that the participants act voluntarily.

The Materials actually confirm the digital history notions
